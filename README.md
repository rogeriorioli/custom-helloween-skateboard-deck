_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge - Halloween Edition, Perfect Landing](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2025-10-15)_

## What I Built

I created an **interactive landing page** where users can **customize their own skateboard shape** with **Halloween-themed prints**.  
The page mixes **punk, horror, and Halloween aesthetics**, featuring dark tones, neon accents, and creepy visuals like skulls, pumpkins, and ghosts.  

Users can:
- **Choose a print** from a gallery of Halloween designs and see it instantly applied to the **skateboard mockup**.  
- **Upload their own artwork** (PNG, JPG, or SVG) to create a truly unique and scary board.  
- **Buy the customized skateboard** directly through a purchase button.  

The goal was to blend **interactivity and e-commerce** with a strong **Halloween visual identity**, appealing to skateboarders who love edgy, horror-inspired art.

## Journey

This project was a blast to build!  
I started with the idea of bringing **Halloween energy into the skate culture**, combining both worlds through a clean yet chaotic interface.  

Technically, I used **React + TailwindCSS**, and implemented interatic click to overlay prints onto the skateboard shape dynamically.  
The biggest challenge was making the image overlay feel natural and visually satisfying â€” like a real printed shape.  

What I learned:
- How to handle **image layering and uploads** efficiently in React.  
- How to design a **dark, high-contrast UI** thatâ€™s still visually balanced.  
- The importance of subtle animations and small visual details (hover glows, fades, etc.) to create immersion.  


Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒ  
*May your code be spooky and your UI delightfully haunted!*
